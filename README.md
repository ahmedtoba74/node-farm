# Node Farm

## Description

This is my first Node.js project built as part of the "Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp" by Jonas Schmedtmann. It's a simple product overview website for a farm, where users can view a list of products, access detailed information, and navigate a fast server-rendered interface using only Node.js core modules.

## Features
- View farm products from a JSON file
- Access detailed product information
- Fast server-rendered interface with no external frameworks

## Technologies Used
- Node.js (core modules: http, fs, url)
- Basic routing and templating without frameworks
